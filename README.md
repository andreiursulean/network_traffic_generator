Using a list of European airports, generate random flights between any reasonable ADEP/ADES pairs at random departure times.
Calculate arrival times (assume flights on the orthodrome, constant speeds and random cruise flight levels)
Display arrival conflicts (flights arriving at the same ADES within a specified time parameter)
